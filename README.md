# OPUS-X

In this paper, we report an open-source toolkit for protein 3D structure modeling, named OPUS-X. It contains three modules: OPUS-TASS2, which predicts protein torsion angles, secondary structure and solvent accessibility; OPUS-Contact, which measures the distance and orientations information between different residue pairs; and OPUS-Fold2, which uses the constraints derived from the first two modules to guide folding. OPUS-TASS2 is an upgraded version of our previous method OPUSS-TASS (Bioinformatics 2020, 36 (20), 5021-5026). OPUS-TASS2 integrates protein global structure information and significantly outperforms OPUS-TASS. OPUS-Contact combines multiple raw co-evolutionary features with protein 1D features predicted by OPUS-TASS2, and delivers better results than the open-source state-of-the-art method trRosetta. OPUS-Fold2 is a complementary version of our previous method OPUS-Fold (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16 (6), 3970-3976). OPUS-Fold2 is a gradient-based protein folding framework based on the differentiable energy terms in opposed to OPUS-Fold that is a sampling-based method used to deal with the non-differentiable terms. OPUS-Fold2 exhibits comparable performance to the Rosetta folding protocol in trRosetta when using identical inputs. OPUS-Fold2 is written in Python and TensorFlow2.4, which is user-friendly to any source-code level modification.
